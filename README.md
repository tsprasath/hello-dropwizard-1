# Introduction

The Dropwizard Hello World application

# Running The Application

To test the example application run the following commands.

* To package the example run the following from the root dropwizard directory.

        mvn package

* To run the server run.

        java -jar target/hello-dropwizard-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server example.yml

* To hit the Hello World example (hit refresh a few times).

	http://localhost:8080/hello-world

	http://localhost:8080/hello-world?name=World

* The healthcheck resource runs the health check class we wrote. You should see something like this:

  * deadlocks: OK
  * template: OK

# Dev Environment Exercise (Please ignore)

## Background
The company you work for is building a dropwizard Restful services.
They have completed their first sprint of work and are ready to begin preparing to ship it. Being a DevOps genius, you know that it will be difficult to reproduce bugs and increase  ownership if there's not an easy way to  reliably run these services locally as you would in production. At the same time, you want to get some automation that can be reused in production.

## Your Task
Your next task is to take the recently built hello-dropwizard service:

- Read the documentation for the Hello Dropwizard service and test them to make sure they work as expected.
- Once you understand their usage, use preferred tools and technology to create automation that stands up local dev environment of the stack.
- You discuss with the engineers that in order for a service oriented architecture to work best, there will need to be some http routing in front of the services so that requests go to the right places. When the stack is deployed, accessing `/hello` should route to the *hello-dropwizard/hello-world*. Use technology and tools you know to implement this behavior.

*Bonus (Optional)*
- If you haven't already, create an efficient docker image based on best practices for at least one service. Be prepared to explain why it's efficient.

## Results

Make the dev environment automation available via a public github repo with any instructions on how to run your dev environment in an accompanying `README.md` file. Send it in and be prepared to discuss it.

# Dev Environment Exercise.
* We have dockerized the application,  (Ref the file [Dockerfile](https://github.com/haroonzone/hello-dropwizard/blob/master/Dockerfile)). 
* Docker Compose is used to manage multiple docker containers and their inter connectivity. In our case we have 2 containers -  Nginx and Dropwizard.  ( Ref File - [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/haroonzone/hello-dropwizard/blobblob/master/docker-compose.yml) )
 
* We are using Nginx to do the redirect ( /hello -> /hello-dropwizard/hello-world ) and a proxy layer before the application and admin endpoint. Nginx Configuration file - [nginx/default.conf](https://github.com/haroonzone/hello-dropwizard/blobblob/master/nginx/default.conf)

Here are the Steps

1. Build the DockerImage with your changes and tag as latest.
     - Docker compose is picking the latest image tag, hence below are tagging the image as latest. 
   
         ``` docker build -t hello-dropwizard:latest . ```


2. Start all Docker Containers  - Nginx and Dropwizard via Docker Compose.
   - Nginx will listen on port 80 and will proxy all request to the port 8080 of Dropwizard container.
   - Nginx will also do the redirct of /hello to /hello-dropwizard/hello-world  as requested in the tasks list.
   - Nginx also  listen on port 81 and will proxy all request to the port 8081 of Dropwizard container.

       ```docker-compose up -d```


3. Check the Below Mentioned Tested Workflows. 


4. Stop all Docker Containers.
   
   ```docker-compose down```

# Vagrant Provisioner: Docker Compose

A Vagrant provisioner for [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Installs Docker Compose and can also bring up the containers defined by a [docker-compose.yml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/yml/).

## Install

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-docker-compose
```

## Usage
### To install docker and docker-compose

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"

  config.vm.provision :docker
  config.vm.provision :docker_compose
end
```

### To install and run docker-compose on `vagrant up`

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"

  config.vm.provision :docker
  config.vm.provision :docker_compose, yml: "/vagrant/docker-compose.yml", run: "always"
end
```

### To install and run docker-compose, with multiple files, on `vagrant up`

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"

  config.vm.provision :docker
  config.vm.provision :docker_compose,
    yml: [
      "/vagrant/docker-compose-base.yml",
      "/vagrant/docker-compose.yml",
      ...
    ],
    run: "always"
end
```

### To install, rebuild and run docker-compose on `vagrant up`

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"

  config.vm.provision :docker
  config.vm.provision :docker_compose, yml: "/vagrant/docker-compose.yml", rebuild: true, run: "always"
end
```
